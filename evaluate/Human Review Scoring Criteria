# Review Scoring Criteria

## 1. Clarity of Issue Description
Evaluates whether the review comment clearly and logically explains the root cause of the issue, with specific references to code snippets or patterns.

- **5 Points (Excellent)**:  
  - The issue description is extremely clear, logically sound, and accurately identifies the root cause of the security problem.  
  - Explicitly references specific code snippets or patterns (e.g., variable names, function calls).  

- **4 Points (Good)**:  
  - The issue description is clear, with mostly correct logic, and identifies the cause of the problem.  
  - Partially references code snippets or patterns, but may lack specificity or be slightly vague.  

- **3 Points (Average)**:  
  - The issue description is generally clear but does not fully explain the root cause, though the problem type is correctly identified.  
  - The description is logically clear, but the problem type is misidentified.  

- **2 Points (Poor)**:  
  - The problem type is misjudged, and the response lacks logical coherence.  
  - The issue description is confusing or incomplete, making it hard to understand.  
  - No code snippets are referenced, making it impossible to locate the issue.  

- **1 Point (Very Poor)**:  
  - Provides no useful information.

## 2. Relevance
Evaluates whether the comment is highly relevant to the code context and security issue, avoiding irrelevant or overly generalized content.

- **5 Points (Excellent)**:  
  - The comment directly addresses the specific security issue in the code and is highly relevant to the context.  
  - Contains no irrelevant or generalized content, focusing solely on the actual issue in the code.  

- **4 Points (Good)**:  
  - The comment is mostly relevant to the code context, with minor misunderstandings or omissions of some details.  

- **3 Points (Average)**:  
  - The problem type is correctly identified, but the comment includes some irrelevant or overly generalized content, or shows a deviation in understanding.  
  - The problem type is misidentified, but the comment is partially relevant and includes some targeted analysis.  

- **2 Points (Poor)**:  
  - Most of the content is overly generalized or off-topic, with significant misunderstanding and little focus on the specific code issue.  

- **1 Point (Very Poor)**:  
  - The comment is completely irrelevant and does not address any security issues related to the code.

## 3. Comprehensiveness of Impact Analysis
Evaluates whether the comment thoroughly explains the potential consequences of the issue, providing developers with sufficient background information.

- **5 Points (Excellent)**:  
  - Provides a comprehensive analysis of the issue’s potential impact, covering all key consequences associated with the label.  

- **4 Points (Good)**:  
  - The impact analysis is mostly comprehensive, addressing the main consequences but possibly missing 1-2 points.  

- **3 Points (Average)**:  
  - The impact analysis is generally complete but only mentions generic consequences, lacking depth.  
  - Due to a misidentified problem type, the impact analysis is incorrect but logically consistent and fairly complete, with some overlap with the labeled consequences.  

- **2 Points (Poor)**:  
  - The problem type is misidentified, and the response lacks logic or alignment with the issue.  
  - The impact analysis is overly broad and fails to address the specific security problem.  

- **1 Point (Very Poor)**:  
  - No impact analysis is provided, or it is entirely missing.

## 4. Actionability of Advice
Evaluates whether the improvement suggestions are specific, feasible, and aligned with security best practices.

- **5 Points (Excellent)**:  
  - The suggestions are highly specific and actionable, providing clear remediation methods (e.g., code snippets, references to best practices).  

- **4 Points (Good)**:  
  - The suggestions are specific and feasible but lack explicit remediation methods (e.g., code snippets, best practice references).  

- **3 Points (Average)**:  
  - The suggestions are generally feasible but too vague, lacking specific implementation details.  
  - The problem type is misidentified, but the suggestion is actionable and provides a specific solution, though it doesn’t address the issue.  

- **2 Points (Poor)**:  
  - The suggestions are vague or infeasible, making them difficult to apply directly to the code.  
  - The problem type is misidentified, and the suggestions lack specificity.  

- **1 Point (Very Poor)**:  
  - No suggestions are provided, or the suggestions are entirely inactionable.
